 Independent summer project for CP-LEADs

This project explores how gender compositions of groups affect the online collaboration environment. The data comes from an online introductory psychology course of 1,713 students where students are randomly grouped together for each of the 9 days. The dataset has 11841 rows and 198 columns. Some information included are sex, chat room ID, age, and group communication analysis (GCA) measures were included (participation, social impact, overall responsivity, internal cohesion, newness, and communication density scores).
